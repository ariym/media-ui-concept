# Search bar and command system

Searches: natural syntax. Fast to type.

Commands: strict syntax. Slower to type but more precise in specificity.
Slower, more capable.

## Search bar triggers

### typing in search bar regular uses natural language mode to find things with emphasis on

- **text similarity**
- **popularity**: measured by personal *and* community engagement, number of times opened, and rating

### "Triggers" refers to what suggestions are shown and in what order

- function: / for suggestions or to start a command, if not first word no / is needed and function is just written as plain word
- tag: # to start command with function
- user: @user_name
- community/server/library: *community_name

## commands syntax

other notes:

- parentheses () to group a series of actions together
- if **function** is not final one in command AND, it passes json data to *next* function

Entering ***multiple commands*** yields a mixed template / result
